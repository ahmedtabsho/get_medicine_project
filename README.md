# get_medicine_project

## Introduction

The ACİL İLAÇ project is designed to quickly and effectively meet medication needs during disaster situations. This Flutter application allows users to easily share and obtain necessary medications in emergencies.

Users can request the medications they need through the system, while others can offer their surplus medications to help. This ensures that medications reach the right people quickly and reliably, improving the critical process of medication supply during disaster situations.
